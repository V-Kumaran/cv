  <h3>My View on Money</h3>
  <p>

    In such a costly and competitive society and world, no one of us can live without money
    <br />
    <p>
      We need money to fulfil our basic needs of the life such as buying food, and other many basic necessities of life which are almost impossible to buy without money. People in the society who are rich and have property are looked as honourable
      and respectful person of the society however a poor person is seen as hatred without any good impression.<br />

      Money increases the position of the person in the society and gives good impression to him. All of us want to be rich by earning more money through good job or business in order to fulfil all the increasing demands of the modern age. However,
      only few people get this chance of completing their dreams of being a millionaire.<br />

      So, money is the thing of great importance all through the life. <br />Money is required by everyone whether he/she is rich or poor ad living in urban areas or rural areas. People in the urban areas are earning more money than the people living
      in backward or rural areas as the people of the urban areas have more access to the technologies and get more opportunity because of the easy sources.
